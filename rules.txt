The way the frozen lake works is simple. There is a grid of squares,
and you (or in this case the agent) starts in the top left square (0, 0).
The goal is to get to the bottom right square of the grid (n-1, n-1).
In each the square can either be frozen (safe to walk) or a hole (unsafe).
You need to avoid the holes and get to the goal.
